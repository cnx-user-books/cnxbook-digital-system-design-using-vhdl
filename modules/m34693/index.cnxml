        <emphasis effect="bold">Just after the invention of transistors in the end of 1947 and the beginning of 1948, Solid State Devices gradually started supplanting Vacuum Tubes . Vacuum Tubes became obsolete because of large size, large electrical power consumption and higher cost. This marked the dawn of Solid State Era. Today by and large Vacuum </emphasis>

        <emphasis effect="bold">In 1959, Jack Kilby of Texas Instrument and Robert Noyce of Fairchild integrated a complete RTL NAND gate on one silicon chip. This marked the birth of Integrated Circuit Technology. This IC Technology was to have such a deep impact on Engineering in particular and on Human Society in general that it ushered in the Third Wave of Civilization(first wave of civilization was ushered in by agriculture and animal husbandry and second wave of civilization was ushered in by James Watt Steam Engine) and Third Information Revolution (first information revolution was marked by the invention of alphabets by Phoenicians and second information revolution was triggered by the invention of Rotating Printing Press by Guttenburg, a German Technician).</emphasis>

So obviously this paradigm of core computing will not be able to keep up with the computing needs of the post-industrial era. So new computing paradigms will have to be invented.</para><para id="eip-714">One of them is Memristor as a circuit element whose resistance drops as current flows through it. HP and South Korean Firm Hynia are expected to launch next year the first memristor based Memory Chips as a replacement of Flash Memory which has the least access time presently. Toshiba has announced the availability of its 0.165m page-mode 64Mb and 128Mb NOR Flash memories that feature a random access time of 60ns and page access time of 20ns. Suitable for use in mobile phones, PDAs, and other wireless handheld applications that require high-performance memory, the devices operate from 2.3V to 3.6V, and draws 55mA when reading, 15mA for program/erase functions, and 1mA during standby. The memristor will provide the alternative to Flash Memory in the coming days.</para><para id="eip-1000">The second possibility is that Graphene based Device may be marketed as the displays in Smart Phones.

Flatland of Graphene is Aliceâs Wonderland.</para><para id="eip-509">Microelectronics engineers are paying attention to Graphene Technology. In semiconductor heterostructures used to make FET devices, for instance, it takes million-dollar epitaxy machines and exquisite care to tie up dangling surface bonds and eliminate impurities in quantum wells. The preparation minimizes the scattering of electrons against interfaces and defects to ensure the largest electron mean-free paths in the device. But this hi-tech processing requires a huge investment in infrastructure.</para><para id="eip-681">But in graphene devices comparable or even better results can be achieved at a much lower cost.  1 Ã thick graphene: scientists have a material that is relatively defect free and whose electrons have a respectable mean-free path naturally, without materials manipulation and processing. Graphene can hardly be more low tech, and yet it still exhibits high
conductivities. âItâs really counterintuitive and remains to be understood,â comments Geim, âbut
the electron wavefunction appears to localize only parallel to the sheet and does not interact with the outside world, even a few angstroms away.â
